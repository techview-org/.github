### 📝 Summary
The interview aspect of job searching in the Software Engineering Industry has been notoriously difficult to overcome, and research has shown that minorities, in particular, tend to be underemployed in the Tech Sector even after obtaining competitive job skills. According to a report by Brookings, the presence of blacks and Hispanics in computer and math jobs remains starkly inadequate at the national level. Blacks make up 11.9 percent of all workers but only 7.9 percent of C&M workers(Muro, “Black and Hispanic underrepresentation in tech”). Broadly speaking,  This can be attributed in large part to the difficulty of technical interviews as well as the lack of support for minorities trying to navigate the interview process.

### 😞 The Problem 
The interview process in the tech industry is notoriously difficult to pass, contributing to the low acceptance rate of minority groups in tech companies. Technical interviews only sometimes test skills used on the job daily, but this information is privy only to those with privileged access to resources or networks.

### 🧗‍♂️ Key Technical Challenge
Technical challenges include implementing a live chat feature between users, anonymizing usernames for private sharing on our platform, utilizing encryption of users' passwords to ensure the security of their posts and accounts, and storing the ratings provided by users about other users to determine which users are most helpful and, ultimately, which users get a badge.

### +++ Extension Opportunities 
Extension opportunities are creating a system in which users can invite friends to join the application and earn badges or advance in leaderboards for users who help the most. Implementing a daily streak feature that entices users to be active in the application more often, culminating in a badge at the end of the month, and a weekly “Trending Tech” section, could foster user engagement.
